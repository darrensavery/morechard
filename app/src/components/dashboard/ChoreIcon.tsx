 * ChoreIcon — renders a chore's stored category icon when available
 * (`iconKey`, set at creation time), falling back to a keyword guess from
 * the title for chores created before icons were persisted.
 *
 * `appView` is the viewing child's own display mode — pass it only from a
 * child-facing screen (their own dashboard/Earn tab). Parent-facing screens
 * (e.g. JobsTab) omit it, which keeps the flat icon regardless of which
 * child is selected — a chore can be assigned to kids on different modes,
 * so the parent's own view shouldn't flip style as they switch children.
