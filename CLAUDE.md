# Morechard PWA — Claude Code Context

## Project Overview
Morechard is a family pocket money PWA.
Parents manage chores, goals, approvals, and payments.
Children track earnings, savings goals, and progress.

## Source of Truth (IMPORTANT)
All authoritative product, brand, and technical knowledge for this project
has been distilled from NotebookLM and is stored locally in:

/docs/notebooklm/

These files are the source of truth.
Claude must consult them automatically when relevant and must not invent
requirements, tone, strategy, or architecture already covered there.

Start with:
/docs/notebooklm/00-index.md

---

## Routing Rule (How Claude Should Decide What to Read)
Before answering or making changes:

1. Check /docs/notebooklm/00-index.md
2. Consult the relevant file(s) based on the task:
   - Coding, data models, APIs, storage, auth, hosting → developer-bible.md
   - UI copy, wording, tone, UX text → ai-personality.md, brand-book.md
   - Roadmap, monetisation, positioning → business-strategy.md
   - Market comparison, differentiation → competitor-analysis.md

If the knowledge base does not specify something:
- Say “Not specified in the Knowledge Base”, OR
- Ask a clarifying question instead of guessing.

## Strategic Tech Direction (IMPORTANT)

### Current Direction
Morechard runs on a **Cloudflare‑native stack** taking advantage of:

- Cloudflare Pages + Functions
- Cloudflare D1 (SQL database)
- Cloudflare environment bindings
- Simpler mental model, lower long‑term cost, tighter platform integration

### Data Layer
- Cloudflare D1 (SQL) is the **only data layer** — do not introduce any other database or storage backend
- Default to Cloudflare D1 + SQL for all storage decisions

### SPA Routing
Use 404.html (copied from index.html at build) for Cloudflare Pages SPA routing.
Do NOT use _redirects — Cloudflare's linter flags `/* /index.html 200` as an
infinite loop warning.

## Working Expectations for Claude
Claude Code is responsible for:
- reasoning
- implementation
- refactoring
- execution within the defined constraints

Claude Code is NOT responsible for:
- re-interpreting original source documents
- re-deriving product decisions already captured
- inventing assumptions when knowledge is missing

When answering non-trivial questions, Claude may briefly note
which /docs/notebooklm files were consulted.

## Key Project Files
- `app/src/lib/deviceIdentity.ts` — Device identity model (one device = one user)
- `app/src/lib/biometrics.ts` — WebAuthn biometric wrapper (Face ID / Touch ID)
- `app/src/screens/LockScreen.tsx` — Auto-challenges biometrics on app open
- `app/src/components/registration/Stage3SecureApp.tsx` — Biometric + PIN setup

## Navigation Rule
- **Stack Reset on Registration Complete:** Once registration is complete, transition to `/parent` using `window.location.href = '/parent'` (never `navigate('/parent')`). This performs a full-page navigation that clears the history stack so the user cannot swipe/go back to onboarding screens.

## Common Commands

### Daily save routine
git add .
git commit -m "describe what changed"
git push

### Start local server
npm run dev

### Deploy to Cloudflare
wrangler deploy

## 📝 Live Roadmap & Task Tracking (8-Phase Master Plan)
> **Claude Instruction:** Update this list after every successful implementation. 

### **Phase 1: Core Foundation (The Truth Engine)**
- [x] Initialize Cloudflare D1 Schema (Families, Kids, Ledger)
- [x] Implement SHA-256 Hash Chain Logic in Worker for every transaction
- [x] Build '6-Digit Child Code' Generation & Verification Logic

### **Phase 2: High-Integrity Onboarding**
- [x] Build 4-Stage Adaptive Registration Flow (UK/US/PL)
- [x] Implement Region-Aware UI (Currency & Terminology Logic)
- [x] Set up 'Better Auth' for secure Parent identity management (custom JWT/magic-link — leaner for Cloudflare)

### **Phase 3: The Transaction Loop (The "Sovereign" Ledger)**
- [x] Build 'Parent Job Create' API & UI
- [x] Build 'Child Mark Done' UI (Virtual Ledger interaction)
- [x] Implement Parent Approval -> Immutable Ledger Write

### **Phase 4: Behavioral Education (The "Simulator" Logic)**
- [x] Build 'Goal Planning' Module — Savings Grove with effort-to-earn mentor, goal creation sheet, purchase flow, parental boosting portal
- [ ] Implement 'Real-World' explainers for Ledger entries (e.g., Inflation/Interest)
- [ ] Create Child 'Equity' Dashboard (Unified view of all virtual assets)

### **Phase 5: The AI Mentor (Behavioral Nudging)**
- [ ] Integrate AI Personality for Child ('Coaching' tone)
- [ ] Implement AI 'Nudges' based on spending patterns
- [x] Build Parent 'Insights' AI (Summarizing child behavior for the week)
  - [x] `insight_snapshots` D1 table — weekly KPI snapshots with trend deltas (consistency, responsibility, planning horizon)
  - [x] Temporal context: delta calculation vs. prior week snapshot, direction indicators (up/down/flat)
  - [x] Velocity context: Seedling (avg tasks/week) vs. Professional (avg £ earned/week)
  - [x] Orchard Lead AI briefing via `@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct` with 5s timeout + rule-based fallback
  - [x] D1 briefing cache — AI runs once per week per child; subsequent loads return instantly
  - [x] Literacy Matrix integration — all briefings grounded in Pillars 1–5 with explicit Pillar naming
  - [x] Pillar 5 surplus trigger — fires when balance > £100 or all goals funded
  - [x] Polish localisation — `getPolishHonorific()`, Pan/Pani formal address, Mistrz Sadu persona, "Honor i Obowiązek Zbiorów" Pillar 5 framing
  - [x] Two AI personas: Orchard Lead (EN, collaborative) vs. Mistrz Sadu (PL, direct/formal)
  - [x] InsightsTab UI — typewriter animation (source=ai only), trend indicators on KPI gauges, parchment-tinted briefing card
  - [x] 'Copy for Child' modal — Seedling (visual/orchard metaphors) and Professional (velocity/streak) templates with "Drafted by your Orchard Mentor" attribution
- [x] Rate Guide — market rate benchmarking for chores
  - [x] Design spec (2026-04-19)
  - [x] D1 migration + 30-row seed (0029_market_rates.sql)
  - [x] GET /api/market-rates + suggest endpoint + CRON skeleton (Monday 03:00 UTC)
  - [x] CreateChoreSheet tile grid + fuzzy search redesign
  - [x] RateGuideSheet (parent) + ChoreGuideSheet (child)
  - [x] Fast-Track suggestion flow (post-save prompt)
- [ ] An AI-driven "Audit" of monthly spending across all children to identify family-wide trends
- [ ] Linking "Seasonal" events (Birthdays, Holidays, School trips) to the Mentor's advice so it can predict future spending needs

### **Phase 6: Compliance & Legal (The "Audit" Factor)**
- [ ] Build 'Court-Ready' PDF Audit Export for co-parents
- [ ] Implement Ledger 'Seal' (Verification page for the PDF)
- [ ] Finalize COPPA/GDPR-K Privacy Controls (Nicknames only)
- [x] Delete Account (Uproot) — `DELETE /auth/family`; lead-only; soft-deletes family row (`deleted_at`), anonymises all user PII (name/email/hashes → NULL), hard-deletes invite codes & registration progress; ledger rows retained anonymised for hash-chain integrity; UI requires typing `UPROOT` to confirm; co-parents must leave before lead can delete

### **Phase 7: Monetization & Global Scale**
- [ ] Integrate Stripe with PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) for GBP/USD/PLN
- [ ] Build 'Lifetime License' vs. 'Subscription' Paywall logic
- [ ] Implement US/UK/PL specific tax/invoice generation (Stripe Tax)

### **Phase 8: Polish & Passive Automation**
- [x] Add Sentry Error Tracking (24/7 solo-dev monitoring)
- [ ] Implement PostHog Session Replays (UX friction hunting)
- [ ] Final PWA Optimization (Offline caching & Push notifications)

### **Infrastructure**
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare staging environment (staging worker + staging D1 + staging Pages branch) with GitHub Actions auto-deploy to production on merge to main
- [ ] Custom domain for the API worker (`api.morechard.com`) — removes `darren-savery.workers.dev` from the Google OAuth consent screen; requires adding custom domain in Cloudflare Workers dashboard, updating redirect URI in Google Cloud Console, and updating the hard-coded `redirectUri` in `worker/src/routes/auth.ts`
