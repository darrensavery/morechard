# Data Process Diagrams (Lucid)

Swimlane diagrams for Morechard's key data flows, maintained in the team Lucid account. Each diagram traces the actual implementation (route, file:line, D1 tables) as of the date noted, grounded by direct codebase inspection — not idealized/aspirational flows. Where a described capability isn't built yet, the diagram says so explicitly (dashed box) rather than inventing steps.

**Maintenance rule:** see `CLAUDE.md` → "Data Process Diagrams — Maintenance Rule". If you change the behavior of any process below (new route, changed table, different step order, new third-party call), update the linked Lucid diagram in the same change, or open a follow-up task to do so.

Note: #14 (Chore Completion Loop) was folded into #3 (Chore-to-Ledger Transaction) rather than documented separately — the approval UI and the ledger-write mechanics are one continuous flow in the codebase.

## Notable gaps surfaced while building these

- **DSAR self-service portal (#4, #5):** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-dsar-portal-design.md` and the accompanying plan describe a public, unauthenticated access/erasure request flow. As of 2026-08-03 this is **spec'd but not implemented** — no `dsar_requests` table, no `dsarExecution.ts`, no `/api/dsar/*` routes exist in `worker/src`. Today's real data-access and erasure flows both require an authenticated parent session.
- **Stripe payment processing (#7):** despite `CLAUDE.md` Phase 7 showing "Integrate Stripe with PPP" and "Build Day 15 Paywall" as unchecked, the core Stripe checkout/webhook/license-grant flow **is fully built** (`worker/src/routes/stripe.ts`). Only PPP currency-adjusted pricing and Stripe Tax invoicing remain outstanding — the roadmap checkboxes were describing those two sub-items, not the integration itself.
- **Governance mutual-consent handshake (new, undiagrammed):** the family-wide `verify_mode` change flow (`worker/src/routes/governance.ts`) was never given its own diagram in this set, and as of 2026-09-15 it has a new sibling — a per-child version covering Approval Mode and Safety Net overrides (`worker/src/routes/childControls.ts`, `child_governance_log` table), documented in `docs/notebooklm/06-developer-bible.md`. Both are request → (solo: self-confirm immediately | co-parenting: pending → other parent confirms/rejects, 72h expiry) flows touching `family_governance_log` / `child_governance_log`. Follow-up: add a swimlane diagram covering both (they're one shape parameterised by scope — family vs. child), rather than diagramming a flow with no visual reference at all.

## Also created (superseded)

An earlier dual-axis (Actor × Platform matrix) version of Process 1 was built and then superseded per user decision in favor of the standard single-axis format used across this whole set: `https://lucid.app/lucidchart/900e34c0-7ba7-4c65-b731-6b5d7c74b0c1/edit`. Kept for reference; not part of the maintained set above.
